# ssht

ssht is a shortcut right into your tmux session on a remote computer.

You can use ssht just like ssh itself - e.g. `ssht root@your_remote_computer.com` will indeed connect you to your remote computer, but instead of simply dropping you to a shell, ssht will try to connect you to a running tmux session on this computer. If there is no tmux session ssht will create on. No magic, but really handy.

Have fun!
